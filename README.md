# Flight Planner

I made various parameters public so that you can edit those numbers when you are running under Unity (not as a standalone app).

Please select “UIDocument” on the left (Hierarchy) and modify parameters (height1/2, radius1/2, latitude/longitude, which specifies the center)
under UI(Script) section and click Plan.

If you are happy with the plan, click “Save” to generate the plan file (“generated.plan”).

The location of the file will be displayed on the debug console.

You need to either open it directly from QGC or move that file to QGC’s Missions folder and open it.
